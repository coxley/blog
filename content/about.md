Hey, thanks for reading! My name is Codey Oxley and I'm a programmer.

Reviewing code is one of my favorite things to do. I think it's because I like
learning intricacies of systems, and passing them on. But most importantly I
care about code quality[^1] --- a lot.

I believe when we lower the friction to write good code by giving thorough examples in
reviews, we see the biggest impact.[^2] After all, people want to write good code. It's
just getting their job done is usually, for good reason, more important.

That's why I started this blog. To share these ideas openly and make it easy
for others to pass on.

[^1]: Is the code idiomatic for the language? If the approach isn't obvious,
      are the trade-offs worth it and made clear? Is it maintainable enough for you
      to work on other things while others take over?

[^2]: Both on quality of code, and in skills of their authors.
